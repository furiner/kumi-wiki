# Global Moderation Team

The **Global Moderation Team *(GMT)*** is a group of people who are responsible for large-scale moderation across the entire game, including ensuring that everything related to the game runs smoothly. They are distinguishable by their user group tag labelled `GMT` with a yellow color to it; as well as their similarly colored title.

Additionally, they are responsible for regulating the upkeep of any issues that may arise in the game, and are responsible for handling reports and appeals; and matters that relate to the game and its community as a whole.

## Responsibilities

The Global Moderation Team is responsible for the upkeep of the game, and ensuring that various aspects of the game run smoothly. It is split into two categories, which can be conveniently split per member of the team, depending on what aspect of the team they are assigned to.

All members of the Global Moderation Team are responsible for the following:

- **Content**: Ensuring that all content in the game is properly moderated, and that any issues that may arise are dealt with accordingly.
- **Communication**: Communicating with the other members of the Global Moderation Team, as well as other teams, and the community at a whole.

In terms of the community, they are responsible for acting as a go-to for the community, and should be able to answer any questions that the community may have, or at least be able to point them in the right direction.

Additionally, all members of the Global Moderation Team are expected to take part in reviews surrounding the [Content usage guidelines](/wiki/Rules/Content_usage_guidelines)

### Leadership

Leadership members of the Global Moderation Team are responsible for the leadership of the team, but with an emphasis on being a point of connection between the rest of the team, and the community. Unlike the leadership category of the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team), they can act largely internally, and are not required to be a point of contact for the community; although they are still required to be able to communicate with the community if necessary.

### Forum

Members of the Global Moderation Team that are assigned to this category of the team are responsible for the upkeep of the [community forum](/forums). They are required to be active on the forum, and are responsible for the upkeep and moderation of the forum.

### In-Game

Members of the Global Moderation Team that are assigned to this category of the team are responsible for the upkeep of the game. This includes issues regarding the game, as well as the chat.

## Promotion

Promotion to the Global Moderation Team is determined on a case-by-case basis, ranging from the candidate's ability to communicate with the community, to their ability to keep up with the game and its community. The process of finding candidates is a largely internal process, and can take a while to find the right candidate.

Unlike the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/Nomination_Assessment_Team), it is a generalized role that applies to the entire game, and holds no particular requirements other than the aformentioned requirements.

As a result, considerations are generally made surrounding a candidate's understanding of the game, and their behavior in the community. The factors that are generally considered are as follows:

- **Activity**: The candidate's activity in the community, and their ability to communicate with the community.
- **Behavior**: How the candidate behaves in the community, and their ability to act as a role model for the community.
- **Knowledge**: The candidate's knowledge of the game, and their ability to understand the game and its community.

### What to Expect

Generally, the conditions that are expected of a candidate are that they are not looking to be promoted, and are not actively seeking promotion. A candidate should not be looking for a means to an end, and should be looking to help the community as a whole.
